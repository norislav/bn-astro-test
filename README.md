# BN Astro Test

This project is a **static website** built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a fast, content-focused static site generator. It features a responsive and fluid design powered by **Tailwind CSS**, and includes dynamic data handling using **JSON** files for content management.

The URL of the site is: https://norislav.github.io/bn-astro-test/


## 1. File and Folder Structure
   
-   **Suggested Directory Structure**:
    
    -   `components/`: Holds reusable components shared across the project.
    -   `layouts/`: Contains layout files that provide consistent structure around pages.
    -   `pages/`: Includes page components that map directly to application routes.
    -   `content/`: Stores content files (e.g., JSON, Markdown) for dynamic content handling.
    -   `styles/`: Houses global styles and component-specific styles.
    -   `assets/`: Contains static assets such as images, icons, and fonts.
-   
    
## 2. Component Organization

Organizing components thoughtfully enhances reusability and code clarity. The suggested organization structure is as follows:

-   **Group Components by Type**:
    
    -   `layouts/`: Includes global layouts that wrap around pages to provide consistent headers, footers, or sidebars.
    -   `sections/`: Contains larger page sections that could be used to build different parts of a webpage, such as "Hero," "Testimonials," or "Footer" sections.
    -   `ui/`: Holds smaller, reusable UI components like buttons, form inputs, and cards. These are often styled elements that are used across multiple sections.
    -   `utilities/`: Houses utility functions, hooks, or custom helpers used to enhance the functionality of components.
-   **Component Naming Conventions**:
    
    -   Use **PascalCase** for component files (e.g., `HeroSection.astro`, `Footer.astro`).
    -   For components that belong to a specific domain, consider prefixing their names (e.g., `TestimonialCard` inside `sections/Testimonials`).

## 3. Styling Best Practices

Consistent styling ensures a uniform look and feel throughout the project:

-   **Use Utility-First CSS with Tailwind**: Tailwind CSS helps avoid writing too much custom CSS by using utility classes for common patterns, leading to consistent styling.
    
-   **BEM-like Naming Convention for Custom Classes**: If you use custom CSS, follow a BEM-like (Block, Element, Modifier) naming pattern to avoid style conflicts and make the code easy to read.
    
-   **Maintain a Theme File for Global Styles**: Use a theme file to define the global color palette, typography, spacing, and other design tokens.
    

## 4. Code Consistency

Maintaining consistent code practices throughout the project is vital for code readability and collaboration:

### Naming Conventions

-   **File and Folder Naming**:
    
    -   Use **PascalCase** for component and layout file names (e.g., `Header.astro`, `MainLayout.astro`).
    -   Use **kebab-case** for folders and utility files (e.g., `utils/helpers.js`, `styles/global.css`).
-   **Component Naming**:
    
    -   Components should follow **PascalCase** (e.g., `HeroSection`, `IconCard`).
    -   Use descriptive and meaningful names for components. Avoid abbreviations unless they're widely known.
-   **Variables and Functions**:
    
    -   Use **camelCase** for variable and function names (e.g., `handleClick`, `fetchData`).
    -   Make sure names reflect the purpose of the function or variable clearly.

### Avoid Code Duplication

-   **Reuse Components**: Always look for opportunities to reuse existing components or utility functions. Avoid copying and pasting similar code across the project.
-   **Refactor Common Patterns into Reusable Utilities**: If you notice repeated code, consider refactoring it into a helper function or a reusable component.
